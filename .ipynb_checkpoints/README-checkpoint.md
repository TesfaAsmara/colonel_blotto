Colonel Blotto
==============

This repository stores code for my math thesis on Colonel Blotto.

I will provide an introduction to the Colonel Blotto game soon.

I am interested in multiple directions:

    - It is important to note that the number of configurations increases drastically as 
    the number of trenches and the number of soldiers increase. This will take a large amount of time 
    to compute and storage to bookmark the results. Can we minimize and estimate the time and storage?
    - How can topological data analysis be utilized to reveal insightful strategies from datasets?
    - Can we quantify the information gain from the subset of games that we have been able to simulate?
    - We can represent the relationship between configurations utilizing a directed graph. 
    What methods can we apply to the graph?
